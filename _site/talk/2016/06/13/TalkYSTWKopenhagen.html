			<h1>YSTW 2016 Copenhagen - A Journey Through the World of Mice and Games - Projective and Beyond</h1>

<div class="post">
  <p>On June 13th, 2016 I gave a talk at the Young Set Theory Workshop in
Copenhagen. For more information see the <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/conferences/2016/yst2016/" target="_blank">webpage of the YSTW 2016</a>.</p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> This talk will be an introduction to inner model theory the at the
level of the projective hierarchy and the $L(\mathbb{R})$-hierarchy. It will
focus on results connecting inner model theory to the determinacy of
certain games.</p>

<p>Mice are sufficiently iterable models of set theory. Martin and Steel
showed in 1989 that the existence of finitely many Woodin cardinals
with a measurable cardinal above them implies that projective
determinacy holds. Neeman and Woodin proved a level-by-level
connection between mice and projective determinacy. They showed that
boldface $\boldsymbol\Pi^1_{n+1}$ determinacy is equivalent to the fact that the
mouse $M_n^\sharp(x)$ exists and is $\omega_1$-iterable for all reals $x$.</p>

<p>Following this, we will consider pointclasses in the $L(\mathbb{R})$-hierarchy
and show that determinacy for them implies the existence and
$\omega_1$-iterability of certain hybrid mice with finitely many
Woodin cardinals, which we call $M_k^{\Sigma, \sharp}$. These hybrid mice
are like ordinary mice, but equipped with an iteration strategy for a
mouse they are containing, which enables them to capture certain sets
of reals. We will discuss what it means for a mouse to capture a set
of reals and outline why hybrid mice fulfill this task.</p>
