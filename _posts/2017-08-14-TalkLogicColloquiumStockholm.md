On August 14th, 2017 I gave a talk in the special session on set
theory at the [Logic
Colloquium 2017](https://www.math-stockholm.se/en/konferenser-och-akti/logic-in-stockholm-2/logic-colloquium-201/logic-colloquium-2017-august-14-20-1.717629)
(August 14-20, 2017). 

*Abstract:* An essential question regarding the theory of inner models
 is the analysis of the class of all hereditarily ordinal definable
 sets $\operatorname{HOD}$ inside various inner models $M$ of the set
 theoretic universe $V$ under appropriate determinacy
 hypotheses. Examples for such inner models $M$ are $L(\mathbb{R})$,
 $L[x]$ and $M_n(x)$. Woodin showed that under determinacy hypotheses
 these models of the form $\operatorname{HOD}^M$ contain large
 cardinals, which motivates the question whether they are
 fine-structural as for example the models $L(\mathbb{R})$, $L[x]$ and
 $M_n(x)$ are. A positive answer to this question would yield that
 they are models of $\operatorname{CH}, \Diamond$, and other
 combinatorial principles. 

The first model which was analyzed in this sense was
$\operatorname{HOD}^{L(\mathbb{R})}$ under the assumption that every
set of reals in $L(\mathbb{R})$ is determined. In the 1990's Steel and
Woodin were able to show that $\operatorname{HOD}^{L(\mathbb{R})} =
L[M_\infty, \Lambda]$, where $M_\infty$ is a direct limit of iterates
of the canonical mouse $M_\omega$ and $\Lambda$ is a partial iteration
strategy for $M_\infty$. Moreover Woodin obtained a similar result for
the model $\operatorname{HOD}^{L[x,G]}$ assuming $\Delta^1_2$
determinacy, where $x$ is a real of sufficiently high Turing degree,
$G$ is $\operatorname{Col}(\omega, {&lt;}\kappa_x)$-generic over
$L[x]$ and $\kappa_x$ is the least inaccessible cardinal in $L[x]$. 

In this talk I will give an overview of these results and outline how
they can be extended to the model $\operatorname{HOD}^{M_n(x,g)}$
assuming $\boldsymbol\Pi^1_{n+2}$ determinacy, where $x$ again is a
real of sufficiently high Turing degree, $g$ is
$\operatorname{Col}(\omega, {&lt;}\kappa_x)$-generic over $M_n(x)$ and
$\kappa_x$ is the least inaccessible cutpoint in $M_n(x)$ which is a
limit of cutpoints in $M_n(x)$. 

This is joint work with Grigor Sargsyan.

This abstract will be published in the Bulletin of Symbolic Logic (BSL).
