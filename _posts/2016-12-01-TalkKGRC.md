On December 1st 2016 I gave a talk in the <a href="http://www.logic.univie.ac.at/Research_seminar.html">KGRC Research Seminar</a>.

*Abstract:* Let $x$ be a real of sufficiently high
Turing degree, let $\kappa_x$ be the least inaccessible cardinal in
$L[x]$ and let $G$ be $Col(\omega, {&lt;}\kappa_x)$-generic over
$L[x]$. Then Woodin has shown that $\operatorname{HOD}^{L[x,G]}$ is a
core model, together with a fragment of its own iteration strategy. 

Our plan is to extend this result to mice which have finitely
many Woodin cardinals. We will introduce a direct limit system of mice
due to Grigor Sargsyan and sketch a scenario to show the
following result. Let $n \geq 1$ and let $x$ again be a real of
sufficiently high Turing degree. Let $\kappa_x$ be the least
inaccessible strong cutpoint cardinal of $M_n(x)$ such that $\kappa_x$
is a limit of strong cutpoint cardinals in $M_n(x)$ and let $g$
be $Col(\omega, {&lt;}\kappa_x)$-generic over
$M_n(x)$. Then $\operatorname{HOD}^{M_n(x,g)}$ is again a core
model, together with a fragment of its own iteration strategy. 

This is joint work in progress with Grigor Sargsyan.
