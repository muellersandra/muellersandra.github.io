title: "1st Irvine Conference on Descriptive Inner Model Theory and
HOD Mice - Producing M_n^#(x) from optimal determinacy hypotheses"
date: 2016-07-19
category: talk
---

On July 19th and 21st I gave talks at the 1st IRVINE CONFERENCE on
DESCRIPTIVE INNER MODEL THEORY and HOD MICE. 

*Abstract:* In this talk we will outline a proof of Woodin's result
 that boldface $\boldsymbol\Sigma^1_{n+1}$ determinacy yields the
 existence and $\omega_1$-iterability of the premouse $M_n^\sharp(x)$ for
 all reals $x$. This involves first generalizing a result of Kechris
 and Solovay concerning OD determinacy in $L[x]$ for a cone of reals
 $x$ to the context of mice with finitely many Woodin cardinals. We
 will focus on using this result to prove the existence and
 $\omega_1$-iterability of $M_n^\sharp$ from a suitable hypothesis. Note
 that this argument is different for the even and odd levels of the
 projective hierarchy. This is joint work with Ralf Schindler and
 W. Hugh Woodin.
