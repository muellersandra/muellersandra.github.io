On July 3rd 2017 I gave a contributed talk at the [6th European Set Theory Conference](https://sites.google.com/site/6thestc/) in Budapest.

*Abstract:* We introduce alternative definitions of density points in
 Cantor space (or Baire space) which coincide with the usual
 definition of density points for the uniform measure on
 ${}^{\omega}2$ up to a set of measure $0$, and which depend only on
 the ideal of measure $0$ sets but not on the measure itself. This
 allows us to define the density property for the ideals associated to
 tree forcings analogous to the Lebesgue density theorem for the
 uniform measure on ${}^{\omega}2$. The main results show that among
 the ideals associated to well-known tree forcings, the density
 property holds for all such ccc forcings and fails for the remaining
 forcings. In fact we introduce the notion of being stem-linked and
 show that every stem-linked tree forcing has the density property. 

This is joint work with Philipp Schlicht, David Schrittesser and Thilo
Weinert.
