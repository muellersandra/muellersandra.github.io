On July 25th I gave a talk at the [4th Münster conference on inner model theory](https://ivv5hpp.uni-muenster.de/u/rds/muenster_meeting_2017.html).

*Abstract:* We analyze $\operatorname{HOD}$ in the inner
 model $M_n(x,g)$ for reals $x$ of sufficiently high Turing degree and
 suitable generics $g$. Our analysis generalizes to other canonical
 minimal mice with Woodin and strong cardinals. This is joint work
 with Grigor Sargsyan. 

Notes taken by Ralf Schindler during my talk can be found
[here](http://www.logic.univie.ac.at/~uhlenbrock/Slides/2017Muenster/MM_2017_uhlenbrock.pdf). These
notes include a sketch of the proof of our main result, the
corresponding preprint will be uploaded on my webpage soon.
