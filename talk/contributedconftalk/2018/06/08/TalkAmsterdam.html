<meta name="description" content="On August 24th, 2018 I gave a short talk at the KNAW Academy Colloquium on Generalised Baire Spaces taking place August 23rd and 24th in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Abstract: Lebesgue introduced a notion of density point of a set of reals and proved that any Borel set of reals has the density property, i.e. it is equal to the set of its density points up to a null set. We introduce alternative definitions of density points in Cantor space (or Baire space) which coincide with the usual definition of density points for the uniform measure on ${}^{\omega}2$ up to a set of measure $0$, and which depend only on the ideal of measure $0$ sets but not on the measure itself. This allows us to define the density property for the ideals associated to tree forcings analogous to the Lebesgue density theorem for the uniform measure on ${}^{\omega}2$. The main results show that among the ideals associated to well-known tree forcings, the density property holds for all such ccc forcings and fails for the remaining forcings. In fact we introduce the notion of being stem-linked and show that every stem-linked tree forcing has the density property.

  <p>On August 24th, 2018 I gave a short talk at the
<a href="http://events.illc.uva.nl/KNAW2018/">KNAW Academy Colloquium on Generalised Baire Spaces</a>
taking place August 23rd and 24th in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em>  Lebesgue introduced a notion of density point of a set of
 reals and proved that any Borel set of reals has the density
 property, i.e. it is equal to the set of its density points up to a
 null set. We introduce alternative definitions of density points in
 Cantor space (or Baire space) which coincide with the usual
 definition of density points for the uniform measure on
 ${}^{\omega}2$ up to a set of measure $0$, and which depend only on
 the ideal of measure $0$ sets but not on the measure itself. This
 allows us to define the density property for the ideals associated to
 tree forcings analogous to the Lebesgue density theorem for the
 uniform measure on ${}^{\omega}2$. The main results show that among
 the ideals associated to well-known tree forcings, the density
 property holds for all such ccc forcings and fails for the remaining
 forcings. In fact we introduce the notion of being stem-linked and
 show that every stem-linked tree forcing has the density property.</p>
