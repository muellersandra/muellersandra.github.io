Determinacy Axioms Set theory can be understood as the search for the right axioms in mathematics, i.e., axioms that answer the questions left open by the standard axioms for set theory introduced by Zermelo and Fraenkel with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). Canonical candidates for these axioms are large cardinals, determinacy axioms, and forcing axioms. We will focus on the second one, determinacy axioms, and say a bit about connections between large cardinals and determinacy. Slides A recording of this talk is available on request." />

<p><em>Determinacy Axioms</em></p>

<p>Set theory can be understood as the search for the right axioms in mathematics, i.e., axioms that answer the questions left open by the standard axioms for set theory introduced by Zermelo and Fraenkel with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). Canonical candidates for these axioms are large cardinals, determinacy axioms, and forcing axioms. We will focus on the second one, determinacy axioms, and say a bit about connections between large cardinals and determinacy.</p>
