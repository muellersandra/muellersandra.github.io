<meta name="description" content="I was invited to give a talk in the TU Wien FG1 Seminar, the Research Seminars of the Set Theory and the Universal Algebra groups, on April 29, 2022. A journey through the world of mice and games This talk will be an informal and gentle introduction to the research area called “inner model theory”. I will introduce determinacy of infinite two player games and outline classical as well as recent results connecting this notion with canonical models of set theory (called “mice”). We will discuss versions of the inner model problem and why they are central to set theory together with recent results suggesting that new methods are required for major advance on these problems." />

  <p>I was invited to give a talk in the TU Wien <a href="https://www.dmg.tuwien.ac.at/fg1/FG1Seminar.html">FG1 Seminar</a>, the Research Seminars of the Set Theory and the Universal Algebra groups, on April 29, 2022.</p>

<p><em>A journey through the world of mice and games</em></p>

<p>This talk will be an informal and gentle introduction to the research area called “inner model theory”. I will introduce determinacy of infinite two player games and outline classical as well as recent results connecting this notion with canonical models of set theory (called “mice”). We will discuss versions of the inner model problem and why they are central to set theory together with recent results suggesting that new methods are required for major advance on these problems.</p>
