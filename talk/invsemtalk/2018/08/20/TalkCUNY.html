<p><em>How to obtain Woodin cardinals from the determinacy of long games</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> We will study infinite two player games and the large
 cardinal strength corresponding to their determinacy. For games of
 length $\omega$ this is well understood and there is a tight
 connection between the determinacy of projective games and the
 existence of canonical inner models with Woodin cardinals. For games
 of arbitrary countable length, Itay Neeman proved the determinacy of
 analytic games of length $\omega \cdot \theta$ for countable $\theta
&gt; \omega$ from a sharp for $\theta$ Woodin cardinals. We aim for a
 converse at successor ordinals and sketch how to obtain $\omega+n$
 Woodin cardinals from the determinacy of $\boldsymbol\Pi^1_{n+1}$
 games of length $\omega^2$. Moreover, we outline how to generalize
 this to construct a model with $\omega+\omega$ Woodin cardinals from
 the determinacy games of length $\omega^2$ with
 $\Game^{\mathbb{R}}\boldsymbol\Pi^1_1$ payoff.</p>
