<p><em>Structural properties of the Stable Core</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> The Stable Core $\mathbb{S}$, introduced by Sy Friedman in
 2012, is a proper class model of the form $(L[S],S)$ for a simply
 definable predicate $S$. He showed that $V$ is generic over the
 Stable Core (for $\mathbb{S}$-definable dense classes) and that the
 Stable Core can be properly contained in HOD. These remarkable
 results motivate the study of the Stable Core itself. In the light of
 other canonical inner models the questions whether the Stable Core
 satisfies GCH or whether large cardinals is $V$ imply their existence
 in the Stable Core naturally arise.</p>

<p>In a joint work with Sy Friedman and Victoria Gitman we give some
 answers to these questions and show that GCH can fail at all regular
 cardinals in the Stable Core. Moreover, we show that measurable
 cardinals in general need not be downward absolute to the Stable
 Core, but in the special case where $V = L[\mu]$ is the canonical
 inner model for one measurable cardinal, the Stable Core is in fact
 equal to $L[\mu]$.</p>
