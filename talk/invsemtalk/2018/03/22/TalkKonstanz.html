<p><em>Large cardinals from the determinacy of games</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> We will study infinite two player games and the large
 cardinal strength corresponding to their determinacy. In particular,
 we will consider mice, which are sufficiently iterable models of set
 theory, and outline how they play an important role in measuring the
 exact strength of determinacy hypotheses. After summarizing the
 situation within the projective hierarchy for games of length
 $\omega$, we will go beyond that and consider the determinacy of even
 longer games. In particular, we will sketch the argument that
 determinacy of analytic games of length $\omega \cdot (\omega+1)$
 implies the consistency of $\omega+1$ Woodin cardinals. This part is
 joint work with Juan P. Aguilera.</p>
