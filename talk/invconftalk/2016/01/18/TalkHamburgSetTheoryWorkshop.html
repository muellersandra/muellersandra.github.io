<p><em>Hybrid Mice with Finitely Many Woodin Cardinals from Determinacy</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> Mice are countable sufficiently iterable models of set theory. Hybrid mice are mice which are equipped with some iteration strategy for a mouse they are containing. This allows them to capture stronger sets of reals.</p>

<p>W. Hugh Woodin has shown in so far unpublished work that boldface $\Pi^1_{n+1}$-determinacy implies that $M_n^\sharp(x)$ exists and is $\omega_1$-iterable for all reals $x$. We will generalize parts of this to hybrid mice and levels of determinacy in the $L(\mathbb{R})$-hierarchy.</p>
