Abstract: In this talk we will outline a proof of Woodin’s result that boldface $\boldsymbol\Sigma^1_{n+1}$ determinacy yields the existence and $\omega_1$-iterability of the premouse $M_n^\sharp(x)$ for all reals $x$. This involves first generalizing a result of Kechris and Solovay concerning OD determinacy in $L[x]$ for a cone of reals $x$ to the context of mice with finitely many Woodin cardinals. We will focus on using this result to prove the existence and $\omega_1$-iterability of $M_n^\sharp$ from a suitable hypothesis. Note that this argument is different for the even and odd levels of the projective hierarchy. This is joint work with Ralf Schindler and W. Hugh Woodin.
