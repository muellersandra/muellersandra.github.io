<meta name="description" content="On June 01, 2019 I was invited to give a talk at the Logic Fest in the Windy City in Chicago, USA. The interplay between inner model theory and descriptive set theory in a nutshell Abstract: The study of inner models was initiated by Gödel’s analysis of the constructible universe $L$. Later, it became necessary to study canonical inner models with large cardinals, e.g. measurable cardinals, strong cardinals or Woodin cardinals, which were introduced by Jensen, Mitchell, Steel, and others. Around the same time, the study of infinite two-player games was driven forward by Martin’s proof of analytic determinacy from a measurable cardinal, Borel determinacy from ZFC, and Martin and Steel’s proof of levels of projective determinacy from Woodin cardinals with a measurable cardinal on top. First Woodin and later Neeman improved the result in the projective hierarchy by showing that in fact the existence of a countable iterable model, a mouse, with Woodin cardinals and a top measure suffices to prove determinacy in the projective hierarchy. This opened up the possibility for an optimal result stating the equivalence between local determinacy hypotheses and the existence of mice in the projective hierarchy, just like the equivalence of analytic determinacy and the existence of $x^\sharp$ for every real $x$ which was shown by Martin and Harrington in the 70’s. The existence of mice with Woodin cardinals and a top measure from levels of projective determinacy was shown by Woodin in the 90’s. Together with his earlier and Neeman’s results this estabilishes a tight connection between descriptive set theory in the projective hierarchy and inner model theory. In this talk, we will outline the main concepts and results connecting determinacy hypotheses with the existence of mice with large cardinals. Neeman’s methods mentioned above extend to show determinacy of projective games of arbitrary countable length from the existence of inner models with many Woodin cardinals. We will discuss a number of more recent results, some of which are joint work with Juan Aguilera, showing that inner models with many Woodin cardinals can be obtained from the determinacy of countable projective games.

  <p>On June 01, 2019 I was invited to give a talk at the <a href="https://homepages.math.uic.edu/~sinapova/Logic%20fest%202019.html">Logic

<p><em>The interplay between inner model theory and descriptive set theory
 in a nutshell</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> The study of inner models was initiated by Gödel’s
 analysis of the constructible universe $L$. Later, it became
 necessary to study canonical inner models with large cardinals,
 e.g. measurable cardinals, strong cardinals or Woodin cardinals,
 which were introduced by Jensen, Mitchell, Steel, and others. Around
 the same time, the study of infinite two-player games was driven
 forward by Martin’s proof of analytic determinacy from a measurable
 cardinal, Borel determinacy from ZFC, and Martin and Steel’s proof of
 levels of projective determinacy from Woodin cardinals with a
 measurable cardinal on top. First Woodin and later Neeman improved
 the result in the projective hierarchy by showing that in fact the
 existence of a countable iterable model, a mouse, with Woodin
 cardinals and a top measure suffices to prove determinacy in the
 projective hierarchy.</p>

<p>This opened up the possibility for an optimal result stating the
equivalence between local determinacy hypotheses and the existence of
mice in the projective hierarchy, just like the equivalence of
analytic determinacy and the existence of $x^\sharp$ for every real
$x$ which was shown by Martin and Harrington in the 70’s. The
existence of mice with Woodin cardinals and a top measure from levels
of projective determinacy was shown by Woodin in the 90’s. Together
with his earlier and Neeman’s results this estabilishes a tight
connection between descriptive set theory in the projective hierarchy
and inner model theory.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will outline the main concepts and results connecting
determinacy hypotheses with the existence of mice with large
cardinals. Neeman’s methods mentioned above extend to show determinacy
of projective games of arbitrary countable length from the existence
of inner models with many Woodin cardinals. We will discuss a number
of more recent results, some of which are joint work with Juan
Aguilera, showing that inner models with many Woodin cardinals can be
obtained from the determinacy of countable projective games.</p>
