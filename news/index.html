<p><em>Universally Baire Sets, Determinacy, and Inner Models</em></p>

<p>Computing the large cardinal strength of a given statement is one of the key research directions in set theory. Fruitful tools to tackle such questions are given by inner model theory. The study of inner models was initiated by Gödel’s analysis of the constructible universe $L$. Later, it was extended to canonical inner models with large cardinals, e.g., measurable cardinals, strong cardinals or Woodin cardinals, which were introduced and studied by Jensen, Mitchell, Steel, Woodin, Sargsyan, and others. We will outline the role universally Baire sets play in the study of inner models and their connections to determinacy axioms. In particular, we will discuss recent results on $\mathsf{Sealing}$, a formalization due to Woodin of the statement that the theory of the universally Baire sets cannot be changed by forcing.</p>

	  <p>I was invited to give a series of two talks in the Core Model Seminar, an online seminar organized by Ernest Schimmerling and Benjamin Siskind, Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

<p><em>A stationary-tower-free proof of Sealing</em></p>

<p>Sealing is a generic absoluteness principle for the theory of the universally Baire sets of reals introduced by Woodin. It is deeply connected to the Inner Model Program and plays a prominent role in recent advances in inner model theory. Woodin showed in his famous Sealing Theorem that in the presence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals Sealing holds after collapsing a supercompact cardinal. In the first talk, I will outline the importance of Sealing and discuss a new and stationary-tower-free proof of Woodin’s Sealing Theorem that is based on Sargsyan’s and Trang’s proof of Sealing from iterability. In the second talk, I will outline the proof of an extension of the Sealing Theorem that gives models in which Theta is regular. This is joint work with Grigor Sargsyan.</p>

	  <p>I am invited to give a talk at the PhDs in Logic XIII conference in Turin, Italy, September 5 - 7, 2022.</p>

<p><em>Highlights from infinite games, mice, and their connection</em></p>

<p>The study of inner models was initiated by Gödel’s analysis of the constructible universe. Later, the study of canonical inner models with large cardinals, e.g., measurable cardinals, strong cardinals or Woodin cardinals, was pioneered by Jensen, Mitchell, Steel, and others. Around the same time, the study of infinite two-player games was driven forward by Martin’s proof of analytic determinacy from a measurable cardinal, Borel determinacy from ZFC, and Martin and Steel’s proof of levels of projective determinacy from Woodin cardinals with a measurable cardinal on top. First Woodin and later Neeman improved the result in the projective hierarchy by showing that in fact the existence of a countable iterable model, a mouse, with Woodin cardinals and a top measure suffices to prove determinacy in the projective hierarchy. This opened up the possibility for an optimal result stating the equivalence between local determinacy hypotheses and the existence of mice in the projective hierarchy. In this talk, we will outline the main concepts and results connecting determinacy hypotheses with the existence of mice with large cardinals as well as recent progress in the area.</p>

<p><em>Universally Baire Sets and the Inner Model Program</em></p>

<p>Universally Baire sets originate in work of Schilling and Vaught, and they were first systematically studied by Feng, Magidor, and Woodin. Since then they play a prominent role in many areas of set theory. We will discuss recent progress on their relationship to the Inner Model Program. First, we will outline the resolution of Sargsyan’s Conjecture on the large cardinal strength of determinacy when all sets are universally Baire. The second part of the talk will focus on sealing the theory of the universally Baire sets.
Woodin showed in his famous Sealing Theorem that in the presence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals $\mathsf{Sealing}$, a generic absoluteness principle for the theory of the universally Baire sets of reals, holds after collapsing a supercompact cardinal.

<p><em>Inner Models, Determinacy, and Sealing</em></p>

<p>Inner model theory has been very successful in connecting determinacy axioms to the existence of inner models with large cardinals and other natural hypotheses.

<p><em>Preserving universally Baire sets and Sealing</em></p>

<p>Universally Baire sets play a central role in many areas of set theory. In inner model theory many objects we construct are universally Baire and this is crucial as it allows us to extend them onto generic extensions. Sealing, a generic absoluteness principle for the theory of the universally Baire sets introduced by Woodin, is therefore an obstruction to construct canonical inner models. In his famous Sealing Theorem, Woodin showed that in the presence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals Sealing holds after collapsing $2^{2^\kappa}$ for a supercompact cardinal $\kappa$. We will outline a new and stationary-tower-free proof of Woodin’s Sealing Theorem that is based on Sargsyan’s and Trang’s proof of Sealing from iterability. A key new technical concept in our proof is the preservation of universally Baire sets in ultrapowers by extenders. This is joint work with Grigor Sargsyan and Bartosz Wcisło.</p>

<p><em>A journey through the world of mice and games</em></p>

<p>This talk will be an informal and gentle introduction to the research area called “inner model theory”. I will introduce determinacy of infinite two player games and outline classical as well as recent results connecting this notion with canonical models of set theory (called “mice”). We will discuss versions of the inner model problem and why they are central to set theory together with recent results suggesting that new methods are required for major advance on these problems.</p>

<p><em>The Interplay of Determinacy, Large Cardinals, and Inner Models</em></p>

<p>The standard axioms of set theory, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with Choice (ZFC), do not suffice to answer all questions in mathematics. While this follows abstractly from Kurt Gödel’s famous incompleteness theorems, we nowadays know numerous concrete examples for such questions.
In addition to a large number of problems in set theory, even many problems outside of set theory have been showed to be unsolvable, meaning neither their truth nor their failure can be proven from ZFC. A major part of set theory is devoted to attacking this problem by studying various extensions of ZFC and their properties with the overall goal to identify the “right” axioms for mathematics that settle these problems.</p>

<p>Determinacy assumptions are canonical extensions of ZFC that postulate the existence of winning strategies in natural infinite two-player games. Such assumptions are known to enhance sets of real numbers with a great deal of canonical structure. Other natural and well-studied extensions of ZFC are given by the hierarchy of large cardinal axioms. Inner model theory provides canonical models for many large cardinal axioms.

<p><em>The Interplay of Determinacy, Large Cardinals, and Inner Models</em></p>

<p>The standard axioms of set theory, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with Choice (ZFC), do not suffice to answer all questions in mathematics. While this follows abstractly from Kurt Gödel’s famous incompleteness theorems, we nowadays know numerous concrete examples for such questions.

A major part of set theory is devoted to attacking this problem by studying various extensions of ZFC and their properties with the overall goal to identify the “right” axioms for mathematics that settle these problems.</p>

<p>Determinacy assumptions are canonical extensions of ZFC that postulate the existence of winning strategies in natural infinite two-player games. Such assumptions are known to enhance sets of real numbers with a great deal of canonical structure. Other natural and well-studied extensions of ZFC are given by the hierarchy of large cardinal axioms. Inner model theory provides canonical models for many large cardinal axioms. Determinacy assumptions, large cardinal axioms, and their consequences are widely used and have many fruitful implications in set theory and even in other areas of mathematics.

<p><em>Lower bounds in set theory</em></p>

<p>Computing the large cardinal strength of a given statement is one of the key research directions in set theory. Fruitful tools to tackle such questions are given by inner model theory. The study of inner models was initiated by Gödel’s analysis of the constructible universe $L$. Later, it was extended to canonical inner models with large cardinals, e.g. measurable cardinals, strong cardinals or Woodin cardinals, which were introduced and studied by Jensen, Mitchell, Steel, Woodin, Sargsyan, and others.</p>

<p>We will outline two recent applications where inner model theory is used to obtain lower bounds in large cardinal strength for statements that do not involve inner models. The first result, joint with Y. Hayut, involves combinatorics of infinite trees and the perfect subtree property for weakly compact cardinals $\kappa$. The second result studies the strength of a model of determinacy in which all sets of reals are universally Baire. Sargsyan conjectured that the existence of such a model is as strong as the existence of a cardinal that is both a limit of Woodin cardinals and a limit of strong cardinals. Larson, Sargsyan and Wilson showed that this would be optimal via a generalization of Woodin’s derived model construction. We will discuss a new translation procedure for hybrid mice extending work of Steel, Zhu and Sargsyan and use this to prove Sargsyan’s conjecture.</p>

<p><em>Uniformization and internal absoluteness</em></p>

<p>Measurability with respect to ideals is known to be tightly connected to absoluteness principles for certain forcing notions. In joint work with Philipp Schlicht we study a uniformization principle that postulates the existence of a uniformizing function on a large set, relative to a given ideal. We prove that for all ideals I such that Borel/I is proper, this uniformization principle is equivalent to an absoluteness principle for projective formulas that we call internal absoluteness. In addition, we show that it is equivalent to measurability with respect to I together with 1-step absoluteness for the poset Borel/I. These equivalences are new even for Cohen and random forcing and are, to the best of our knowledge, the first precise equivalences between regularity and absoluteness beyond the second level of the projective hierarchy.</p>

<p><em>Determinacy Axioms</em></p>

<p>Set theory can be understood as the search for the right axioms in mathematics, i.e., axioms that answer the questions left open by the standard axioms for set theory introduced by Zermelo and Fraenkel with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC). Canonical candidates for these axioms are large cardinals, determinacy axioms, and forcing axioms. We will focus on the second one, determinacy axioms, and say a bit about connections between large cardinals and determinacy.</p>

<p><em>The Large Cardinal Strength of Determinacy Axioms</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> The study of inner models was initiated by Gödel’s analysis of the constructible universe $L$. Later, it became necessary to study canonical inner models with large cardinals, e.g. measurable cardinals, strong cardinals or Woodin cardinals, which were introduced by Jensen, Mitchell, Steel, and others. Around the same time, the study of infinite two-player games was driven forward by Martin’s proof of analytic determinacy from a measurable cardinal, Borel determinacy from ZFC, and Martin and Steel’s proof of levels of projective determinacy from Woodin cardinals with a measurable cardinal on top. First Woodin and later Neeman improved the result in the projective hierarchy by showing that in fact the existence of a countable iterable model, a mouse, with Woodin cardinals and a top measure suffices to prove determinacy in the projective hierarchy.</p>

<p>This opened up the possibility for an optimal result stating the equivalence between local determinacy hypotheses and the existence of mice in the projective hierarchy, just like the equivalence of analytic determinacy and the existence of $x^\sharp$ for every real $x$ which was shown by Martin and Harrington in the 70’s. The existence of mice with Woodin cardinals and a top measure from levels of projective determinacy was shown by Woodin in the 90’s. Together with his earlier and Neeman’s results this estabilishes a tight connection between descriptive set theory in the projective hierarchy and inner model theory.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will outline some of the main results connecting determinacy hypotheses with the existence of mice with large cardinals and discuss a number of more recent results in this area.</p>

<p><em>How to obtain lower bounds in set theory</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> Computing the large cardinal strength of a given statement is one of the key research directions in set theory. Fruitful tools to tackle such questions are given by inner model theory. The study of inner models was initiated by Gödel’s analysis of the constructible universe $L$. Later, it was extended to canonical inner models with large cardinals, e.g. measurable cardinals, strong cardinals or Woodin cardinals, which were introduced by Jensen, Mitchell, Steel, and others.</p>

<p>We will outline two recent applications where inner model theory is used to obtain lower bounds in large cardinal strength for statements that do not involve inner models. The first result, in part joint with J. Aguilera, is an analysis of the strength of determinacy for certain infinite two player games of fixed countable length, and the second result, joint with Y. Hayut, involves combinatorics of infinite trees and the perfect subtree property for weakly compact cardinals $\kappa$. Finally, we will comment on obstacles, questions, and conjectures for lifting these results higher up in the large cardinal hierarchy.</p>

<p><em>Das Unbegreifliche verstehen - die Faszination Unendlichkeit</em></p>

<p>Jeder kennt sie, sie ist immer da, aber nie so richtig - die Unendlichkeit. Aber was meinen wir eigentlich, wenn wir sagen, dass etwas unendlich groß ist? Gibt es nur die eine Unendlichkeit oder zwei oder vielleicht sogar ganz viele?</p>

<p>Wir werden diese Fragen und natürlich auch die dazugehörigen Antworten etwas genauer unter die Lupe nehmen. Dabei wird sich nicht nur zeigen, wozu Mathematik in der Lage ist, sondern wir werden uns auch auf den Weg zu den Grenzen der Mathematik machen, wie sie zum Beispiel von Cantor und Gödel aufgezeigt wurden. Diese Grenzen besser zu verstehen - getreu nach dem Spruch von Oliver Tietze „Wer mit dem Feuer spielen will, muss wissen, wo das Wasser steht.“ - ist noch heute Gegenstand mathematischer Spitzenforschung.</p>

<p><em>Infinite decreasing chains in the Mitchell order</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> It is known that the behavior of the Mitchell order substantially changes at the level of rank-to-rank extenders, as it ceases to be well-founded. While the possible partial order structure of the Mitchell order below rank-to-rank extenders is considered to be well understood, little is known about the structure in the ill-founded case. We make a first step in understanding this case by studying the extent to which the Mitchell order can be ill-founded. Our main results are (i) in the presence of a rank-to-rank extender there is a transitive Mitchell order decreasing sequence of extenders of any countable length, and (ii) there is no such sequence of length $\omega_1$. This is joint work with Omer Ben-Neria.</p>

<p><em>Sealed Trees and the Perfect Subtree Property for Weakly Compact Cardinals</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> We investigate the consistency strength of the statement: $\kappa$ is weakly compact and there is no tree on $\kappa$ with exactly $\kappa^{+}$ many branches. We show that this property fails strongly (there is a <em>sealed tree</em>) if there is no inner model with a Woodin cardinal. On the other hand, we show that this property as well as the related Perfect Subtree Property for $\kappa$, implies the consistency of $\operatorname{AD}_{\mathbb{R}}$. This is joint work with Yair Hayut.</p>

<p><em>Lower bounds for the perfect subtree property at weakly compact cardinals</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> By the Cantor-Bendixson theorem, subtrees of the binary tree on $\omega$ satisfy a dichotomy - either the tree has countably many branches or there is a perfect subtree (and in particular, the tree has continuum many branches, regardless of the size of the continuum). We generalize this to arbitrary regular cardinals $\kappa$ and ask whether every $\kappa$-tree with more than $\kappa$ branches has a perfect subtree. From large cardinals, this statement is consistent at a weakly compact cardinal $\kappa$. We show using stacking mice that the existence of a non-domestic mouse (which yields a model with a proper class of Woodin cardinals and strong cardinals) is a lower bound. Moreover, we study variants of this statement involving sealed trees, i.e. trees with the property that their set of branches cannot be changed by certain forcings, and obtain lower bounds for these as well. This is joint work with Yair Hayut.</p>

	  <p>As a part of the workshop on “The Core Model Induction and Other Inner
Model Theoretic Tools” in Rutgers I gave a tutorial on HOD
Computations.</p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> An essential question regarding the theory of inner models is the
analysis of the class of all hereditarily ordinal definable sets HOD
inside various inner models $M$ of the set theoretic universe $V$
under appropriate determinacy hypotheses. Examples for such inner
models $M$ are $L(\mathbb{R})$ or $L[x]$ on a cone of reals $x$. We
will outline Steel’s and Woodin’s analysis of
$HOD^{L(\mathbb{R})}$. Moreover, we will discuss their analysis of
$HOD^{L[x,G]}$ on a cone of reals $x$, where $G$ is
$Col(\omega,\kappa)$-generic and $\kappa$ is the least inaccessible
cardinal in $L[x]$. We will point out were the problems are when
trying to adapt this to analyze $HOD^{L[x]}$.</p>

	  <p>On June 01, 2019 I was invited to give a talk at the <a href="https://homepages.math.uic.edu/~sinapova/Logic%20fest%202019.html">Logic
Fest in the Windy City</a> in Chicago, USA.</p>

<p><em>The interplay between inner model theory and descriptive set theory
 in a nutshell</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> The study of inner models was initiated by Gödel’s
 analysis of the constructible universe $L$. Later, it became
 necessary to study canonical inner models with large cardinals,
 e.g. measurable cardinals, strong cardinals or Woodin cardinals,
 which were introduced by Jensen, Mitchell, Steel, and others. Around
 the same time, the study of infinite two-player games was driven
 forward by Martin’s proof of analytic determinacy from a measurable
 cardinal, Borel determinacy from ZFC, and Martin and Steel’s proof of
 levels of projective determinacy from Woodin cardinals with a
 measurable cardinal on top. First Woodin and later Neeman improved
 the result in the projective hierarchy by showing that in fact the
 existence of a countable iterable model, a mouse, with Woodin
 cardinals and a top measure suffices to prove determinacy in the
 projective hierarchy.</p>

<p>This opened up the possibility for an optimal result stating the
equivalence between local determinacy hypotheses and the existence of
mice in the projective hierarchy, just like the equivalence of
analytic determinacy and the existence of $x^\sharp$ for every real
$x$ which was shown by Martin and Harrington in the 70’s. The
existence of mice with Woodin cardinals and a top measure from levels
of projective determinacy was shown by Woodin in the 90’s. Together
with his earlier and Neeman’s results this estabilishes a tight
connection between descriptive set theory in the projective hierarchy
and inner model theory.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will outline the main concepts and results connecting
determinacy hypotheses with the existence of mice with large
cardinals. Neeman’s methods mentioned above extend to show determinacy
of projective games of arbitrary countable length from the existence
of inner models with many Woodin cardinals. We will discuss a number
of more recent results, some of which are joint work with Juan
Aguilera, showing that inner models with many Woodin cardinals can be
obtained from the determinacy of countable projective games.</p>

<p><em>Projective determinacy for games of length $\omega^2$ and longer</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> We will study infinite two player games and the large
 cardinal strength corresponding to their determinacy. For games of
 length $\omega$ this is well understood and there is a tight
 connection between the determinacy of projective games and the
 existence of canonical inner models with Woodin cardinals. For games
 of arbitrary countable length, Itay Neeman proved the determinacy of
 analytic games of length $\omega \cdot \theta$ for countable $\theta
 &gt; \omega$ from a sharp for $\theta$ Woodin cardinals.</p>

<p>We aim for a converse at successor ordinals. In joint work with Juan
 P. Aguilera we showed that determinacy of $\boldsymbol\Pi^1_{n+1}$
 games of length $\omega^2$ implies the existence of a premouse with
 $\omega+n$ Woodin cardinals. This generalizes to a premouse with
 $\omega+\omega$ Woodin cardinals from the determinacy of games of length
 $\omega^2$ with $\Game^{\mathbb{R}}\boldsymbol\Pi^1_1$ payoff.</p>

<p>If time allows, we will also sketch how these methods can be adapted
to, in combination with results of Nam Trang, obtain $\omega^\alpha+n$ Woodin 
cardinals for countable ordinals $\alpha$ and natural numbers $n$ from 
the determinacy of sufficiently long projective games.</p>

Theory Workshop 4</a>) in Kilpisjärvi, Finland.</p>

<p><em>Homogeneous Spaces and Wadge Theory</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> In his PhD thesis Wadge characterized the notion of
continuous reducibility on the Baire space ${}^\omega\omega$ in form
of a game and analyzed it in a systematic way. He defined a refinement
of the Borel hierarchy, called the Wadge hierarchy, showed that it is
well-founded, and (assuming determinacy for Borel sets) proved that
every Borel pointclass appears in this classification. Later Louveau
found a description of all levels in the Borel Wadge hierarchy using
Boolean operations on sets. Fons van Engelen used this description to
analyze Borel homogeneous spaces and show that every homogeneous Borel
space is in fact strongly homogeneous.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will show how to generalize these results under the
Axiom of Determinacy. In particular, we will outline that under AD
every homogeneous space is in fact strongly homogeneous.</p>

<p>This is joint work with Raphaël Carroy and Andrea Medini.</p>

<p><em>Structural properties of the Stable Core</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> The Stable Core $\mathbb{S}$, introduced by Sy Friedman in
 2012, is a proper class model of the form $(L[S],S)$ for a simply
 definable predicate $S$. He showed that $V$ is generic over the
 Stable Core (for $\mathbb{S}$-definable dense classes) and that the
 Stable Core can be properly contained in HOD. These remarkable
 results motivate the study of the Stable Core itself. In the light of
 other canonical inner models the questions whether the Stable Core
 satisfies GCH or whether large cardinals is $V$ imply their existence
 in the Stable Core naturally arise.</p>

<p>In a joint work with Sy Friedman and Victoria Gitman we give some
 answers to these questions and show that GCH can fail at all regular
 cardinals in the Stable Core. Moreover, we show that measurable
 cardinals in general need not be downward absolute to the Stable
 Core, but in the special case where $V = L[\mu]$ is the canonical
 inner model for one measurable cardinal, the Stable Core is in fact
 equal to $L[\mu]$.</p>

taking place August 23rd and 24th in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em>  Lebesgue introduced a notion of density point of a set of
 reals and proved that any Borel set of reals has the density
 property, i.e. it is equal to the set of its density points up to a
 null set. We introduce alternative definitions of density points in
 Cantor space (or Baire space) which coincide with the usual
 definition of density points for the uniform measure on
 ${}^{\omega}2$ up to a set of measure $0$, and which depend only on
 the ideal of measure $0$ sets but not on the measure itself. This
 allows us to define the density property for the ideals associated to
 tree forcings analogous to the Lebesgue density theorem for the
 uniform measure on ${}^{\omega}2$. The main results show that among
 the ideals associated to well-known tree forcings, the density
 property holds for all such ccc forcings and fails for the remaining
 forcings. In fact we introduce the notion of being stem-linked and
 show that every stem-linked tree forcing has the density property.</p>

	  <p>On July 9th, 2018 I gave a 90min talk in the Oberseminar
Mathematical Logic at the University of Konstanz, Germany.</p>

<p><em>Large cardinals from the determinacy of games</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> We will study infinite two player games and the large
 cardinal strength corresponding to their determinacy. In particular,
 we will consider mice, which are sufficiently iterable models of set
 theory, and outline how they play an important role in measuring the
 exact strength of determinacy hypotheses. After summarizing the
 situation within the projective hierarchy for games of length
 $\omega$, we will go beyond that and consider the determinacy of even
 longer games. In particular, we will sketch the argument that
 determinacy of analytic games of length $\omega \cdot (\omega+1)$
 implies the consistency of $\omega+1$ Woodin cardinals. This part is
 joint work with Juan P. Aguilera.</p>

	  <p>In the first week of April 2018 I will visited the <a href="http://logicatorino.altervista.org/indexeng.html">Mathematical Logic
group of Turin</a> and
gave a 2h talk on April 6.</p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> Lebesgue introduced a notion of density point of a set of
 reals and proved that any Borel set of reals has the density
 property, i.e. it is equal to the set of its density points up to a
 null set. We introduce alternative definitions of density points in
 Cantor space (or Baire space) which coincide with the usual
 definition of density points for the uniform measure on
 ${}^{\omega}2$ up to a set of measure $0$, and which depend only on
 the ideal of measure $0$ sets but not on the measure itself. This
 allows us to define the density property for the ideals associated to
 tree forcings analogous to the Lebesgue density theorem for the
 uniform measure on ${}^{\omega}2$. The main results show that among
 the ideals associated to well-known tree forcings, the density
 property holds for all such ccc forcings and fails for the remaining
 forcings. In fact we introduce the notion of being stem-linked and
 show that every stem-linked tree forcing has the density property.</p>

	  <p>On March 06, 2018 I gave an invited talk in the Section in Logic at the annual
meeting <a href="http://www.gdmv2018.de">GDMV</a> of the German Mathematical
Society (DMV) joint with GDM taking place March 5th to 9th in
Paderborn, Germany.</p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> In his PhD thesis Wadge characterized the notion of continuous
reducibility on the Baire space ${}^\omega\omega$ in form of a game
and analyzed it in a systematic way. He defined a refinement of the
Borel hierarchy, called the Wadge hierarchy, showed that it is
well-founded, and (assuming determinacy for Borel sets) proved that
every Borel pointclass appears in this classification. Later Louveau
found a description of all levels in the Borel Wadge hierarchy using
Boolean operations on sets. Fons van Engelen used this description to
analyze Borel homogeneous spaces.</p>

<p>In this talk, we will discuss the basics behind these results and show
the first steps towards generalizing them to the projective hierarchy,
assuming projective determinacy (PD). In particular, we will outline
that under PD every homogeneous projective space is in fact strongly
homogeneous.</p>

	  <p>On Dec 1st, 2017, at 10:00am I gave a talk in the <a href="https://boolesrings.org/victoriagitman/cuny-logic-seminars/cuny-set-theory-seminar">CUNY
Set Theory Seminar</a>.</p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> An essential question regarding the theory
of inner models is the analysis of the class of all hereditarily
ordinal definable sets $\operatorname{HOD}$ inside various inner
models $M$ of the set theoretic universe $V$ under appropriate
determinacy hypotheses. Examples for such inner models $M$ are
$L(\mathbb{R})$, $L[x]$ and $M_n(x)$. Woodin showed that under
determinacy hypotheses these models of the form $\operatorname{HOD}^M$
contain large cardinals, which motivates the question whether they are
fine-structural as for example the models $L(\mathbb{R})$, $L[x]$ and
$M_n(x)$ are. A positive answer to this question would yield that they
are models of $\operatorname{CH}, \Diamond$, and other combinatorial
principles.</p>

<p>The first model which was analyzed in this sense was
$\operatorname{HOD}^{L(\mathbb{R})}$ under the assumption that every
set of reals in $L(\mathbb{R})$ is determined. In the 1990’s Steel and
Woodin were able to show that $\operatorname{HOD}^{L(\mathbb{R})} =
L[M_\infty, \Lambda]$, where $M_\infty$ is a direct limit of iterates
of the canonical mouse $M_\omega$ and $\Lambda$ is a partial iteration
strategy for $M_\infty$. Moreover Woodin obtained a similar result for
the model $\operatorname{HOD}^{L[x,G]}$ assuming $\Delta^1_2$
determinacy, where $x$ is a real of sufficiently high Turing degree,
$G$ is $\operatorname{Col}(\omega, {&lt;}\kappa_x)$-generic over $L[x]$
and $\kappa_x$ is the least inaccessible cardinal in $L[x]$.</p>

<p>In this talk I will give an overview of these results (including some
background on inner model theory) and outline how they can be extended
to the model $\operatorname{HOD}^{M_n(x,g)}$ assuming
$\boldsymbol\Pi^1_{n+2}$ determinacy, where $x$ again is a real of
sufficiently high Turing degree, $g$ is $\operatorname{Col}(\omega,
{&lt;}\kappa_x)$-generic over $M_n(x)$ and $\kappa_x$ is the least
inaccessible cardinal in $M_n(x)$.</p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> Let $x$ be a real of sufficiently high
Turing degree, let $\kappa_x$ be the least inaccessible cardinal in
$L[x]$ and let $G$ be $Col(\omega, {&lt;}\kappa_x)$-generic over
$L[x]$. Then Woodin has shown that $\operatorname{HOD}^{L[x,G]}$ is a
core model, together with a fragment of its own iteration strategy.</p>

<p>Our plan is to extend this result to mice which have finitely
many Woodin cardinals. We will introduce a direct limit system of mice
due to Grigor Sargsyan and sketch a scenario to show the
following result. Let $n \geq 1$ and let $x$ again be a real of
sufficiently high Turing degree. Let $\kappa_x$ be the least
inaccessible strong cutpoint cardinal of $M_n(x)$ such that $\kappa_x$
is a limit of strong cutpoint cardinals in $M_n(x)$ and let $g$
be $Col(\omega, {&lt;}\kappa_x)$-generic over
$M_n(x)$. Then $\operatorname{HOD}^{M_n(x,g)}$ is again a core
model, together with a fragment of its own iteration strategy.</p>

DESCRIPTIVE INNER MODEL THEORY and HOD MICE.</p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> In this talk we will outline a proof of Woodin’s result
 that boldface $\boldsymbol\Sigma^1_{n+1}$ determinacy yields the
 existence and $\omega_1$-iterability of the premouse $M_n^\sharp(x)$ for
 all reals $x$. This involves first generalizing a result of Kechris
 and Solovay concerning OD determinacy in $L[x]$ for a cone of reals
 $x$ to the context of mice with finitely many Woodin cardinals. We
 will focus on using this result to prove the existence and
 $\omega_1$-iterability of $M_n^\sharp$ from a suitable hypothesis. Note
 that this argument is different for the even and odd levels of the
 projective hierarchy. This is joint work with Ralf Schindler and
 W. Hugh Woodin.</p>

Copenhagen. For more information see the <a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/conferences/2016/yst2016/" target="_blank">webpage of the YSTW 2016</a>.</p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> This talk will be an introduction to inner model theory the at the
level of the projective hierarchy and the $L(\mathbb{R})$-hierarchy. It will
focus on results connecting inner model theory to the determinacy of
certain games.</p>

<p>Mice are sufficiently iterable models of set theory. Martin and Steel
showed in 1989 that the existence of finitely many Woodin cardinals
with a measurable cardinal above them implies that projective
determinacy holds. Neeman and Woodin proved a level-by-level
connection between mice and projective determinacy. They showed that
boldface $\boldsymbol\Pi^1_{n+1}$ determinacy is equivalent to the fact that the
mouse $M_n^\sharp(x)$ exists and is $\omega_1$-iterable for all reals $x$.</p>

<p>Following this, we will consider pointclasses in the $L(\mathbb{R})$-hierarchy
and show that determinacy for them implies the existence and
$\omega_1$-iterability of certain hybrid mice with finitely many
Woodin cardinals, which we call $M_k^{\Sigma, \sharp}$. These hybrid mice
are like ordinary mice, but equipped with an iteration strategy for a
mouse they are containing, which enables them to capture certain sets
of reals. We will discuss what it means for a mouse to capture a set
of reals and outline why hybrid mice fulfill this task.</p>

<p><em>Hybrid Mice with Finitely Many Woodin Cardinals from Determinacy</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> Mice are countable sufficiently iterable models of set theory. Hybrid mice are mice which are equipped with some iteration strategy for a mouse they are containing. This allows them to capture stronger sets of reals.</p>

<p>W. Hugh Woodin has shown in so far unpublished work that boldface $\Pi^1_{n+1}$-determinacy implies that $M_n^\sharp(x)$ exists and is $\omega_1$-iterable for all reals $x$. We will generalize parts of this to hybrid mice and levels of determinacy in the $L(\mathbb{R})$-hierarchy.</p>

	  <p>On September 23, 2015, I gave a talk in the Minisymposium <em>Set Theory</em> at the <a href="https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/dmv2015/index.html">DMV-Jahrestagung</a> in Hamburg.</p>

<p><em>Mice with finitely many Woodin cardinals from optimal determinacy hypotheses</em></p>

<p><em>Abstract:</em> Mice are countable sufficiently iterable models of set theory. Itay Neeman has shown that the existence of such mice with finitely many Woodin cardinals implies that projective determinacy holds. In fact he proved that the existence and $\omega_1$-iterability of $M^{\sharp}_n(x)$ for all reals $x$ implies that boldface $\Pi^1_{n+1}$-determinacy holds.</p>

<p>We prove the converse of this result, that means boldface $\Pi^1_{n+1}$-determinacy implies that $M^{\sharp}_n(x)$ exists and is $\omega_1$-iterable for all reals $x$. This level-wise connection between mice and projective determinacy is an old so far unpublished result by W. Hugh Woodin. As a consequence we can obtain the determinacy transfer theorem for all levels $n$. These results connect the areas of inner model theory and descriptive set theory, so we will give an overview of the relevant topics in both fields and briefly sketch a proof of the result mentioned above. The first goal is to show how to derive a model of set theory with Woodin cardinals from a determinacy hypothesis. The second goal is to prove that there is such a model which is iterable. For this part the odd and even levels of the projective hierarchy are treated differently.</p>

<p>This is joint work with Ralf Schindler and W. Hugh Woodin</p>
